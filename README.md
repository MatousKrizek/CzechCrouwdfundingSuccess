# CzechCrouwdfundingSuccess
This repository includes data and scripts used in the creation of my Bachelor thesis 'Determinants of Crowdfunding Success.' Data from crowdfunding websites Hithit.com and Startovac.cz is obtained, cleaned, and the data from Hithit.com is used for data analysis.

Included files:
1. HithitScraper.py - Iterates through project pages of crowdfunding projects on Hithit.com, downloading all their HTMLs. This one is simple, as there were no anti-bot measures on the site at the time of use.
2. StartovacLinkScraper.py - As in Startovac, the web addresses of the project pages are not named systematically, this script searches for all symbols of the keayboard on the search bar and downloads all the contetn.
3. LinksStartovacRaw.pickle - Content of all search results obtained by scipt (2). This file cannot be uploaded due to size (101 MB). - NOT INCLUDED
4. StartovacSearchFilter.py - Filtering script to gather all the links from the search results (2). Result is a list of links to all found projects, purging duplicates. The total number of links optained is close to the total number of all projects ever published on the platform, as I obtained this number from the platform owners. This way is also effective
5. LinksStartovac.pickle - List of links obtained from the downloaded content (3)
6. StartovacScraper.py - Takes the list of links (5) and obtains the HTML of each project page. However, after roughly 1 000 pages, it is not able to capture the comment section, which is outsourced to a Facebook plugin, which is able to reveal this automathic scraping and refuses to give more information. As this is the only place I found on the Startovaƒç website to give date of the project, I ended up with most of the project pages not including the date of beginning or ending, and therefore had to drop the observations from the data analysis, as the date or at least the year of the project was necessary for several variables.
